Arduino Mega :)

Howdy visitor!

I know that you are curious. But hold on. I will start building this project step-by-step.

It's an interesting self-learning challenge based on Arduino Mega 2650 and will come with Youtube videos.

Youtube series (in Turkish) can be found on my channel;

## Features:

### SRAM (SDCard Ram - Variable Storage Engine for Arduino Mega)

### MScript (Multitasking Scripting Engine for Arduino Mega)

## NOTE!

This is still an unstable work-in-progress and there can be many bugs. This is just a prototype and probably will not be a stable thing ever.

My goal is to create a computer of 1970s-80s using an Arduino Mega 2560.
